## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classic-bloody-piano.git
cd classic-bloody-piano
```

### 2. Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### 3. Manual Run (Without Docker)

Just open `index.html` in your browser — no server needed.  
**Note:** Opened as a local file, notes play through `<audio>` elements. Serving the folder (e.g. Docker, or [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code) uses the Web Audio API instead, which has lower latency.

## Customization

- **Add More Notes**: Place additional `.mp3` files in the `sounds/` folder and update the key mapping in `script.js`.
- **Change Rhythms**: Edit the rhythm cards in `index.html`. Each button takes `data-rhythm` (keyboard keys, e.g. `A,S,D`), `data-pattern` (each note's length in beats) and `data-beat-ms` (one beat in milliseconds). Melodies must fit the C4–C5 keys, so transpose them if needed.
